# Grader

Grader is a Python tool designed to simplify the process of converting numerical grades from Google Classroom into alphabetical grades, primarily targeting educators working with elementary school and kindergarten students. The tool aims to streamline the grading experience, making it more intuitive and aligned with the grading standards for young learners.

## Objective
The main objective of Grader is to offer a user-friendly solution for teachers to convert numerical marks obtained from Google Classroom into alphabetical grades, thereby catering to the specific needs of educators dealing with younger students.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Utilizes the Pandas library for data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Data Preparation**: Manipulates CSV files using Python for accurate grading.
- **Data Manipulation**: Employs Object-Oriented Programming principles to mark files according to provincial grading standards.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow these steps:
    - Download the Google Classroom grade as CSV format.
    - Rename the new file as 'grades.csv'.
    - Run the 'Data Cleaner.py'.
    - Run the 'Marker.py'.

## Implementation
- Piloted in 2021 as a functional prototype by a group of teachers within the Halton District School Board.
- Further refined and utilized by teachers in the Peel District School Board in 2022.

## Outcomes
- Reduced grading time for teachers, allowing for more focused instructional activities.
- Improved grading accuracy, contributing to enhanced student feedback and assessment practices.

## Limitations
- Requires two files to achieve the desired result.
- Files must adhere to specific naming conventions.
- Limited to the Ontario Grading Scheme as of September 2022.
- Lack of dynamic adaptability may result in inaccuracies.

## Future Enhancements
- **Expansion**: Plans to incorporate additional provincial grading standards.
- **GradingSync**: Integration of real-time official grading schemes for improved accuracy.
